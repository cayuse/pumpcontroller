// We can define up to a default of 50 cmds total, including both directions (send + recieve)
// and including also the first 4 default command codes for the generic error handling.
// If you run out of message slots, then just increase the value of MAXCALLBACKS in CmdMessenger.h

// Commands we send from the Arduino to be received on the PC
enum
{
  kCOMM_ERROR    = 000, // Lets Arduino report serial port comm error back to the PC (only works for some comm errors)
  kACK           = 001, // Arduino acknowledges cmd was received
  kARDUINO_READY = 002, // After opening the comm port, send this cmd 02 from PC to check arduino is ready
  kERR           = 003, // Arduino reports badly formatted cmd, or cmd not recognised

  // Now we can define many more 'send' commands, coming from the arduino -> the PC, eg
  // kICE_CREAM_READY,
  // kICE_CREAM_PRICE,
  // For the above commands, we just call cmdMessenger.sendCmd() anywhere we want in our Arduino program.
